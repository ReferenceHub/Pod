### Months
* *January*

	* [Spectre / Meltdown](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/) Every story has to end, and sadly, we saw the ending of almost all generations of processors ( Intel, AMD, etc ) on the same day this bug was reported, some architectures were saved from this, but for the rest, they were already doom from the moment they born. But as always, this will lead to new neat technology and everyone would only remember this as a miss step.
	
	* [Amazon Go](https://whnt.com/2018/01/28/inside-amazon-go-the-store-of-the-future/) Have you ever want to go to that Tambo, grab a Coca Cola and some chips and run away like you were stealing the store. Well wait no more, Amazon Go  will grant you this experience for the affordable price of the products you want and a couple of Gigabytes of data so their machine learning algorithm can work properly.

* *February*

	* [Falcon Heavy - 6 de Febrero](https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/02/three-years-of-sls-development-could-buy-86-falcon-heavy-launches/)  In a nutshell the Falcon Heavy is a big f****ng rocket form with 3 attached Falcon 9 rockets, which can be compare to rockets built government institutions, like the NASA.
	
	* [Why it took 5  years for the Falcon Heavy to fly - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOdoNQXQYv8) As silly as it sounds to just attach 3 rockets and to function as one, this took a hella lot of time to built, one reason was because the Falcon 9 went through a lot of changes before it‚Äôs current design and they need to ensure the security of the whole thing. 

* *March*

	* [GDPR](https://www.wired.com/story/europes-new-privacy-law-will-change-the-web-and-more/) The old question ‚ÄúWhat information does Google or Facebook has of me?‚Äù was answered by the EU, with the new regulations added in March, and also the reason why we have tons of emails of different pages saying they‚Äôre will change they *Term of service*. 

	* [Cambridge Analytica scandal](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal) The doom fall of Facebook, part one, Cambridge Analytica. Do you ever wonder what would happen if by any reason you left this little gray area in your applications, where some capable person could go and grab tons of free information of your clients ? Well Facebook did that, at one point, and then Capitan Insight came by and said they shouldn‚Äôt be doing that, but it was too late.

	* [Samsung Galaxy S9](https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/08/samsung-galaxy-s9-and-s9-plus-review-video/) Ok, this phone is cool, but not very memorable, so in summary, good job Samsung on not adding a notch and still making a great phone.

* *April*

	* [Facebook and the US Congress](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/9/17215758/facebook-zuckerberg-congress-updates-analysis-livestream)  The doom fall of Facebook, part 2, Mark in the congress. Ok there is tons of news covering this one, but most of us may just remember the facial expressions of Mark, like Mark drinking and not drinking water. But that‚Äôs not the most important thing we need to remember, we need to remember that the congressmen needs a new adviser with expertise in technology, because man that questions were too much.

* *May*

	* [Google I/O](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17328828/google-io-keynote-summary-highlights-news-recap-2018) One of the most important events of the year, because it gives us a glimpse on what google has behind the curtain!

	* [Ray Tracing!](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/20/17758724/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-specs-pricing-release-date-features) Do you feel your life doesn‚Äôt have enough ray tracing ? Well, Nvidia announce they newest series to solve that problem for you. 

	* [Samsung‚Äôs Note 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihEhAbVRC78) Personally I think this phone is great and one of the best phones of the year, it has a great battery, great display and a great place to save the pencil ( Apple I‚Äôm looking at you ).

	* [Google‚Äôs keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsoQGTA1SxY) One of the worst keynotes of the year, not for all the products, but for how it was presented. And also the announcement of the most leaked phone of 2018.

	* [OnePlus‚Äô keynote](https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/29/life-with-oneplus-6t-hands-on/) Bad luck One Plus had to change the date of their keynote because Apple schedule one on the same day, bad Apple bad.

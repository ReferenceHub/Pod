#### Notes
- Riot’s official NA and EU interviewers will be in attendance, though.
- Riot has struggled to secure a venue for the finals of Worlds this year.
- Viewers, unsurprisingly, started to wonder if Riot was cutting costs, possibly in response to the game's perceived drop-off in popularity.
- *"We want to to invest even more than what we do now in the future, but only if it makes sense for the business.”.*
- Some clues Riot is cutting back budget:
	- The MSI was being held in EU studios for most of the tournament.
	- The NA LCS Spring Finals was held in a 1000 capacity music venue.
	- Riot casters won't even to go to Korea for almost all *Worlds*.
	- Worlds finals are not even held in Seoul or Busan but *Incheon* instead.

### Nvidia RTX cards

#### Notes
- SOTTR under 60fps with RTX ?
	- In a video we can see the new 2080 Ti  running a demo of Shadow of the Tomb Raider with RTX enabled in 1080p and it gets between 30 and 70 fps (this video was recorded with **FRAPS!**).
	- The frame rate would increase significantly when the card didn’t have to render environments, like when looking at a wall. However, the average rate while running around in the world was only 30-45 fps.
- What the fuck, Tom’s Hardware ?
	- *“When your whole life flashes before your eyes, how much of it do you want to not have ray tracing ?”*
- What the fuck, again, Tom’s Hardware ?
- Nvidia’s benchmarks could be a little skewed (DLSS).
- No pre-ordering!

**And again**
